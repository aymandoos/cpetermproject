Fitness tool

 The main objective of our program is a  fitness tracker that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI),
 displays a progress bar, counts the number of steps a person takes, and calculates the number of calories burned. 
 The program includes several functions and global variables. 
 The bmicalc() function calculates a person's BMI based on their height and weight, which the user can adjust using buttons on the screen. 
 The progress() function displays a progress bar that shows how close the user is to reaching a set daily step goal. 
 The stepcounter() function uses an accelerometer to detect the user's steps and displays the number of steps taken. 
 The calculate() function calculates the number of calories burned based on the user's weight and step count. 
 The program also includes several global variables that are used in these functions, such as the user's height, weight, and step count.
